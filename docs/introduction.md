# Introduction & Teaching Philosophy

::: info Who Is This Document For?
This training is designed for **Functional Consultants** who need to:
*   Understand how Odoo stores and manages data
*   Communicate effectively with developers
*   Write functional specifications that developers can implement
*   Configure Odoo without writing code (using Studio)
*   Troubleshoot issues and understand error messages

**You don't need to write code** - but understanding the concepts will make you much more effective.
:::

::: tip The Building Analogy
Think of Odoo like a **large office building**:
*   **Models** = Different departments (Sales, HR, Warehouse)
*   **Fields** = Information each department keeps (customer name, employee salary)
*   **Records** = Individual files in each department (one customer, one employee)
*   **Views** = How you look at the information (form, list, chart)
*   **Access Rights** = Who can enter which department and what they can do there
:::

## Teaching Approach

We focus on the **"why"** behind each concept, not just the "how". When you understand why something works a certain way, you can:
1.  Make better configuration decisions
2.  Troubleshoot problems faster
3.  Communicate effectively with developers
4.  Advise clients with confidence
